Thanks for reaching out! I'm glad you're
enjoying our products. :) The difference
between the Curl Elixir and Whipped
Curl Creme is that the Whipped Curl
Creme is a bit heavier and more
moisturizing for thicker, drier hair. If your
hair is on the finer side or you have
looser curls, I'd recommend you stick
with the Curl Elixir. If your hair is really
thick and tends to feel dry, I'd give the
Whipped Curl Creme a try. Let me know
if you have any other questions.
